# reactNative_ToDoApp
This repo showcases a basic React Native "To Do List" application that I created.

See below for a video of the app flow in-use (in-browser, with mobile screen dimensions).

This app is **ready to run on mobile**, via Expo Go, for iOS or Android (with a localhost instance of this repo running).

## Features included:
- Designed with **React Native** and **Expo**
- `Modal` screen with `slide` animation
- Custom components (with function-call props)
- Dynamic flexbox styling (for mobile-friendly views)
- JS-object styling (with `react-native` `StyleSheet`)

iOS and Android UI-specific testing and troubleshooting has not been conducted for this demo app. That can be further conducted with the help of simulators, or the Expo Go app on hardware devices. The purpose of the app in this repo is just to demonstrate my understanding of foundational React Native design principles.
